# 1. Spot Exchange Markets

## Quote of Exchange Rate

- HC:  Home Currency

- FC: Foreign Currency

- Direct Quote: HC/FC (use FC as "1"/"100")

  - For convenience, this notes use direct quote unless specifically stated 

- Indirect Quote: FC/HC (use HC as "1")

  - Indirect quote convention:

    1) USD: between 1994 - mid-80s every exchange went through USD (e.g. DEM/CHF = DEM/USD * USD/CHF)

    2. GBP: The pound used to be intractably non-decimal until 1967
    3. EUR

- Market Conventions 

  - The market uses the opposite convention
    - Base/Variable
      - Base: one of the base unit                      Variable: n = 1 base


  - American Terms (direct quote): EUR/USD, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, GBP/USD (e.g. *1* EUR can exchange for *n* dollar)


  - European Terms (indirect quote): USD/JPY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, USD/SEK, USD/NOK (e.g. *1* dollar can exchange for *n* JPY)


## Digit of FX (Foreign Exchange) quote

- An FX quote ususally consists of 5 digits: 1.1510 (1.15: big figures   10:pips)
- sopt rates are often quoted only with their pips

## Bid and Ask Rates

- Bid - Ask

  - Bid Price: the highest price a **buyer** is willing to pay in the market

  - Ask Price: the lowest price a **seller** is willing to accept in the market
  - Bid &le; Ask 

- spread = ask - bid
  - spread depends on: liquidity of the currency, size of the deal, time of the day (e.g. holidays, lunchtime)

- Purchase can be thought occurs at the <u>midpoint</u>, and bank earns the commissions (spread between two sides) 

## Inverting Exchange Rates in the Presence of Spread

- We use effective interest rate not annulized interest rate -- so we need to deannulized the rate.
- bid price $\rightarrow$ ask price; ask price $\rightarrow$ bid price
  - $S^{CAD/USD}_{bid,t} = \frac{1}{S^{USD/CAD}_{ask,t}}$
  - $S^{CAD/USD}_{ask,t} = \frac{1}{S^{USD/CAD}_{bid,t}}$

- Suppose the quote on the screen: USD/CAD 1.000 - 1.005
  - The bank's buying rate (bid) for CAD is 1.000
  - The bank's selling rate (ask) for CAD is 1.005
  - The bank's buying rate (bid) for USD is 1/1.005 = 0.9950
  - The bank's selling rate (ask) for USD is 1/1.000 = 1.000

## Value dates

- the day on which physical exchange of the currencies occurs
- Value Today; Value Tom (occur on the next business day); Value Spot (occur two business day from today); Value Forward (a specified date beyond the spot date)

- Market convention: all qoutes are expressed as Value Spot

## Exchange Rates Movement

- Currency Appreciation & Depreciation
  - Previous exchange rate = X (Currency A/ Currency B)   &rarr;  Current exchange rate = Y (Currency A/ Currency B)
    - exchange rate &darr;  (X > Y) : A has appreciation; B has depreciation
    - exchange rate &uarr;  (Y > X): A has depreciation; B has appreciation
- Calculate exchange rate fluctuations:
  - 1) convert exchange rate to $\frac{Benchmark \ Currency}{Fluctuating \ Currency}$ 
    2) is the fluctuating currency <u>appreciation</u> or <u>depreciation</u>  (fraction decrease  &rarr;  fluctuating currency is depreciation; fraction increase  &rarr;  fluctuating currency is appreciation)
    3) calculate the percentage change: % change = $\frac{Amount \ Change}{Oringinal \ Exchange \ Rate} \ * 100$
- Expression: X currency has appreciated/depreciated agianst Y currency

## Dealing in the currrency exchange

- Market Makers: aims to profit from the bid/ask price they quote 

- Brokers: Market-makers inform brokers of their bid/ask prices; customer contacts brokers -- borkers select the best bid and ask price from market- makers for customers

  - Electronic broker system: EBS, Reuters 3000

- Reuters Conversation

  - e.g. 

    #EURUSD 10			&rarr;          This bank is asking for 10m EUR (base) against USD(variable)
     12 14  				  &rarr;           pips (bid & ask)      (assume the regular rate is 1.1512 - 1.1514)

    #URS  				   &rarr;            "yours " (I sell)       (opposite "mine" for "I buy")

    OK TO CONFIRM I BUY EUR 10 MIO AGAINST USD AT 1.1512  

    MY EUR DIRECT PLS  

    #TO CONFIRM I SELL EUR 10 MIO AGAINST USD AT 1.1512  

    #MY USD TO CITI N.Y. PLS
    #TKS VM AND BIBI 

    #END REMOTE

## The Law of One Price for Spot Exchange Quotes

- the law enforced by two mechanisms: 
  - Arbitrage -- buy low sell high
    - e.g. HKD/GBP
      - BANK A: Bid 12.150           Ask 12.158
      - BANK B: Bid 12.160           Ask  12.168
      - Buy GBP from BANK A, then can sell at a higher price at BANK B
    - utilize the bid-ask price gap between different banks
    - arbitrage transaction is a <u>round-trip process</u>
    - FX trader: find out arbitrage opportunity
      - plot out bid-ask price plot<img src="/Users/rosa/Documents/github_repository/Gavin-OP.github.io/public/notes/fina/Foreign Exchange/image/1.1.png" alt="1.1" style="zoom:50%;" />
  - Least cost dealing  -- shopping around (pick a better price to buy/sell)
    - e.g. HKD/GBP
      - BANK A: Bid 12.150           Ask 12.158
      - BANK B: Bid 12.154           Ask  12.162
    - Buy GBP from BANK A at 12.158; Sell GBP to BANK B at 12.154
    - GBP flows from BANK A to BANK B (when A has an excess of GBP & B is short of GBP)
    - do not buy and sell <u>at the same time</u>
    - Plot  <img src="/Users/rosa/Documents/github_repository/Gavin-OP.github.io/public/notes/fina/Foreign Exchange/image/1.2.png" alt="1.2" style="zoom:50%;" />
  - Why need to draw plots $\rightarrow$ when there are a lot of bid-ask prices from many banks
  - why a bank lack of one currency: different bank has different customers
  - When a bank want to accumulate currency A -- at the same time need to scare off the buyers -- so the bid-ask price will not increase at the same time (will not be an arbitrage opportunity)

## Triangular Arbitrage and Least Cost Dealing

- Noun interpretation
  - outright quotes: rates offerd by banks directly
  - implied rate: e.g. $\frac{JPY}{USD} * \frac{USD}{GBP} = \frac{JPY}{GBP}$ 
  
- Triangular arbitrage: try to make money by sequentially buying and selling three currencies, ending with the original currency
  - Process
    - Borrow <u>1 of currency A</u>
    - Sell 1 currency A for X currency B
    - Sell X currency B for Y currency C
    - Use Y currency C to buy currency A (get <u>more than 1 A</u>)  --- <u>back to the currency A</u> 
  - Why we start with currency A: no need to fix one currency
    - can start and end at any currency among A, B and C
    - if the outcomes are not same $\rightarrow$ mispircing
  - But there is always "an error" during the process $\rightarrow$ anti- "buy low sell high"
  
- Triangular least cost dealing: search for the best way to achieve the desired conversion
  - Target: use currency B to buy X currency A (find out the lowest currency B)
    - buy directly
    - Buy through other currency C in the middle
    - compare the two method, and find out which method is cheaper to buy X currency A
  
- Computing Synthetic Cross-Rates
  - Step 1: Multiply / Divide
  
  - Step 2: Ask / Bid
    - Rip-off rule: always the most extreme 
      - synthetic bid: lowest product     e.g.
      
        $S^{JPY/GBP}_{t, bid} = S^{JPY/USD}_{t, bid} \times S^{USD/GBP}_{t, bid}= \frac{S^{JPY/USD}_{t, bid}}{S^{GBP/USD}_{t, ask}}$ 
      
      - synthetic ask: highest product    e.g.
      
        $S^{JPY/GBP}_{t, ask} = S^{JPY/USD}_{t, ask} \times S^{USD/GBP}_{t, ask}= \frac{S^{JPY/USD}_{t, ask}}{S^{GBP/USD}_{t, bid}}$
